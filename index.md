## Contributing

We welcome all kinds of contributions, questions, and discussions related to the formalization of mathematical logic.

### How to Contact / Proposing Idea

**Please open a new topic at [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/FormalizedFormalLogic/discussions).**

The reason is simple: handling similar inquiries individually (for example, requests for advice on formalizing a particular area) can easily lead to duplicated effort.

If you do not have a GitHub account or you think your message should remain confidential, please send an email us using the contact information provided on the [developers section](#developers).

### Language

We primary use Japanese in discussion, but English is also ok.

## Financial Supports

Any financial supports would be grateful for us.
If you found this project valuable, to sustain our OSS development, please consider support us.
