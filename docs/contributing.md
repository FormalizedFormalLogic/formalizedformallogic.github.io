# Contributing

We welcome all kinds of contributions, questions, and discussions related to the formalization of mathematical logic.

## How to Contact

Please open a new topic at [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/FormalizedFormalLogic/discussions) unless your message needs to be kept confidential.

The reason is simple: handling similar inquiries individually (for example, requests for advice on formalizing a particular area) can easily lead to duplicated effort.

If you do not have a GitHub account or you think your message should remain confidential, please send an email us using the contact information provided on the developers' page.

## Language

We primary use Japanese in discussion, but English is also ok.
